# GROUP-6_SDG4_Digital-Library-Information-System
## Project Description
The Digital Library Information System (DLIS) is a database-driven system designed to support
public and community libraries in providing equal and inclusive access to learning materials.

The system enables libraries to:
- Organize and manage book and material records
- Track borrowing and returning transactions
- Monitor item availability in real time
- Generate reports to support informed library management decisions

This project directly supports **United Nations SDG 4 – Quality Education**, specifically:
- SDG 4.1: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all
- SDG 4.3: Increase access to affordable learning resources
- SDG 4.5: Reduce inequalities in access to education

Core DBMS concepts applied in this project include:
- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling and normalization
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and integrity constraints
- Stored procedures, functions, and triggers
- Transaction management for borrowing and returning books
- Role-based access control using DCL statements
